<h1>Top movies according to Adrian (me) </h1>
<h2> I mean idk how i sorted it because i dont remember almost any</h2>
<hr/>
<h3> Mission Impossible 4</h3>
<p> The best action movie of all times, ofc with James Bond but we'll see that down below</p>
<h3>James Bond- Spectre</h3>
<p> I mean the connection of thrilling ellements and boost of testosterone by hot actors and actresses is just amazing</p>
<h3> Devil Wears Prada</h3>
<p> The best fashion movie created. Despite the fact that it's old the fashion is not limited in time and the combination of Anne Hathaway and Miranda is amazing. Miranda is an idol of many people </p>
<h3> Inferno</h3>
<p> No words to that one, you have to see it as the next one following in my ladder</p>
<h3> DaVinci Code</h3>
<p> for someone who is passionate about history, mystery and riddle, this movie is a cheff's kiss</p>
<h3>In time</h3>
<p> Distopian theme where the system takes over people and will desides to break it and forms a rebellion, one of very few movies that are so unique</p>
<h3>Hunger Games</h3>
<p> As if it was needed for me to say why</p>
<h3>Welcome to Eden</h3>
<p> Full of twists and turns and dark procedures, the concept of it is so thrilling it's hard not to be tense while watching</p>
